The website that we have built offers a digital solution for the NUST Medical Centre. Our website offers a user to access all the functionalities of NUST Medical Centre through their devices without any human interference. NMC provides health-based services, which is focused on medical care for students. In case of emergency situations, NMC offers to call an ambulance for the well-being of the students of NUST. If a student is ill, he/she can book an appointment with a doctor from the list of available doctors, without the hassle of manually visiting the clinics. The students can purchase medicines from the pharmacy that is present within the vicinity of the medical centre.


Medical websites are an important use case when it comes to website development. It is a recent trend among website developers and start-ups to focus on medical technology. One of the websites that we saw as an inspiration was tabiyat.pk and another was marham.pk. We integrated the functionalities of both these websites under a single platform. marham.pk offers a solution to accessing doctors online while tabiyat.pk offers a solution to e-commerce medical stores.


The primary motivation of the project is that currently, the NUST Medical Centre is heavily dependent on human activity. To simply call an ambulance, one needs to call the medical centre. To book an appointment with a doctor, one needs to contact the medical centre representative or be there in person. For even the simplest tasks of buying medicines from their pharmacy, the customer needs to visit the medical centre physically. Our website automates all this process. Further details will be shared in the functional requirements.
